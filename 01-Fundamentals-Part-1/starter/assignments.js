/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).

1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)
3. Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message can be either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

HINT: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰

/**
 * LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
   1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
   prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
   have?');
   2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
   == for now)
   3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
   is greater than 1
   4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
   'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
   5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
   6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
   'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
   is this happening?
   7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
   when you input 1
   8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
   situation
